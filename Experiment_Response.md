**Experiment Response**

**1) What is the role of elasticity in congestion pricing? Can you call this price discrimination?**
Congestion pricing as a strategy aims at reducing usage of public goods, say infrastructure like roads in urban areas, electricity usage during lean months, where supply is limited but the demand likely increases over time. This is achieved by charging the usage, through fees and tolls of routes especially in the core usage areas either for general access or during peak hours. This is like pricing the roads based on demand, like any other good. Examples could be pricing peak hour usage of a main streets in the core areas of the city

Elasticity here would refer to the number of vehicles travelling in the congested areas or on such roads in response to change in price (associated with fees and tolls).
If driving demand is inelastic, then congestion pricing would not be very effective and congestion would not reduce much i.e. increase in price would not lead to reduction in number of vehicles for that route. If the elasticity is high, then congestion would reduce significantly with increase in fees, tolls (i.e. change in price).

Although, congestion pricing seems relatable to price discrimination and to an extent it is a dynamic pricing strategy, they are likely different mostly on the underlying objective because differential pricing is primarily undertaken to benefit the supplier and take advantage of consumer’s willingness to pay whereas congestion pricing is primarily implemented to control for and reduce demand (i.e. change consumer behaviour) given limited resources. Differential pricing is aimed at targeting specific consumers to maximize supplier utility.
In the case of vehicles, surge pricing by cab aggregators is differential pricing and has a different objective than congestion pricing taken up by say, civic authorities.

**2) Think of another social problem and see how differential pricing can help you abate the issue.**
Excessive water consumption – Govt can use a differential pricing structure and leverage water tariffs to curb the excessive consumption of water to model usage behaviour towards reduction and efficient use while keeping social equity in mind similar to income taxation i.e. charging beyond basic minimum usage. 
Differential taxation will increase the marginal cost of consumption, which pushes the price of water usage upward. 
Q1 –Tariff rate T1 ; Q2 –Tariff rate T2 ; Q3 –Tariff rate T3 ; …
Where Q1 < Q2 < Q3 & T1 < T2 < T3

**Learnings from this coordination exercise –** 
1.	Yes, the batch coordinated and arrived at a consensus to take a common response approach (either no answer from all or the same answer from all) after multiple rounds of discussions in group messages (over Whatsapp).
2.	After initial coordination across 80 and building the final approach, 16 SPOCs, one per assignment group were made responsible for their group members submitting the same response from their group members.
3.	From experiment 1 to 2, our approach for common responses did not change and we still wanted to go with a common response because the incentive for individualism was still very low while the risks of folks defecting was the same in both experiments.
